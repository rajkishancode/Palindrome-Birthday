# Palindrome-Birthday

A simple vanilla JS web app that lets you know if your birthday is a palindrome or not !

Any sequence of characters which reads the same when read from backwards as it is from forwards, is considered a Palindrome.

So it will check if any of these variations of date formats would result in a palindrome :-

DD/MM/YYYY
MM/DD/YYYY
MM/YYYY/DD
DD/YYYY/MM
YYYY/DD/MM
YYYY/MM/DD
